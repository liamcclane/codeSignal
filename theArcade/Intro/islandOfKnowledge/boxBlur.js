/**Box Blur
 * Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo 
 * of you that's about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, 
 * so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
 * 
 * The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. 
 * The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: 
 * Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average 
 * value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its center 
 * at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border 
 * of x are then removed.
 * 
 * Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * let ex1 = [
 *     [1, 1, 1],
 *     [1, 7, 1],
 *     [1, 1, 1]
 * ]
 * boxBlur(ex1) should return [[1]]
 * because (1+1+1+1+7+1+1+1+1) = 15/9 = 1.6666 => 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * let ex2 = [
 *     [7, 4, 0, 1],
 *     [5, 6, 2, 2],
 *     [6, 10, 7, 8],
 *     [1, 4, 2, 0]
 * ]
 boxBlur(ex2);
 returns [[5,4], [4,4]]
